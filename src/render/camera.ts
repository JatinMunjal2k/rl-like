/**
 * Rocket League chase camera, reproduced from measurements of car-soccer.com's camera kernel
 * (which runs RL's own camera rules). Everything below was fitted to that kernel's outputs
 * over dozens of probed scenes and matches it to within a degree and a few uu.
 *
 * Common: a pivot sits `height` above the car. The camera is pulled `distance` back from the
 * pivot along the smoothed view direction (so the `angle` tilt also raises the camera), the arm
 * grows with speed by (1 - stiffness) * speed / 20, and the camera never goes below 10 uu.
 * The view direction eases toward its target with a first-order lag. FOV is horizontal and
 * widens by 10° while supersonic.
 *
 * Ball cam: the pivot uses world up and rises by 0.9 uu per degree of the ball's elevation.
 * Yaw points at the ball. Pitch is a blend of `angle` and the ball's elevation E from the pivot:
 * weight 0 below 22°, ramping to 0.8 at 44° and staying there. So a very high ball is followed
 * only 80% of the way and the car can leave the frame, exactly as in RL.
 *
 * Car cam: yaw follows the nose heading, holding through flips (a heading jump past 90° is
 * ignored) and near-vertical noses. In the air the pitch is just `angle` and the roll is level,
 * so air rolls and flips leave the view alone. On a surface the pivot rides the car's up, the
 * pitch follows about three quarters of the nose pitch and the roll a tenth of the bank.
